# Student-Performance-analysis-by-Machine-learning
Use of machine learning and data science makes life easier in every aspect, using machine learning and predicting the outcomes before the exam will allow the students as well as their parents and teachers to analyze the improvement area. we adopt numerous machine learning concepts and algorithms in order to predict the grades of the student before an exam. And machine learning is booming, and machine learning is firmly identified with (and frequently covers with) computational insights, which also focuses on prediction making through the use of technology. It has solid connections to numerical improvement, which conveys strategies, hypothesis and application areas to the field. Machine learning is some of the time conflated with data mining where the latter subfield concentrates more on exploratory information analysis and is known as supervised learning.
The main idea of this project is:
• In this project our aim is to analyze all the factors affecting the grades of a student and then predicting the grades of the student based upon those factors.
• We are implementing different supervised regression models for prediction of the grades.
• Using R-Squared, MAE, MSE, RMSE to evaluate the best model among all the
implemented supervised regression models.
• The outcome of the algorithms predicts the number of students who are likely to pass,
fail or promoted to next year. The results provide steps to improve the performance of the students who were predicted to fail or promoted.
